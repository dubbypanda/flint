### Graph View
- Interactive **force-directed graph** visualization
- Node size scales with connection count
- Physics simulation - drag nodes, connected notes follow
- Zoom, pan, search, depth filter
- Curved edges between connected notes

### AI Agent (`Ollama`)
- **Real Python backend** that connects to Ollama locally (*if you lunch from terminal*)
- **Notes = Memory** - AI reads all your notes and graph connections
- **Internet access** - AI searches Wikipedia for real-time info
- **Works with ANY Ollama model** (which have tool calling support) - llama3.2, mistral, codellama, phi3, etc.
- **Streaming responses** in real-time
- **Browser fallback** when agent is not running

### Local & Secure 
- **No cloud, no tracking** - all data stays on your device
- **localStorage** for persistence
- **No external API calls** (except Wikipedia when internet access is enabled)
- **File System Access API** to open any local folder as a vault

## Aim

- [ ] Local hosted models use the internet and give you answers (if you ask)
- [ ] A flint agent can change the content in your notes by itself.
- [ ] Flint can manage all notes and can do tasks in that working space as per your command.
